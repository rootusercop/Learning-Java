In the below mentioned program, we undersand two things:

1. This is to understand creating and initializing 1D, 2D arrays. Doing initialization and creation in the same step,
does not require 'new' operator. PLEASE UNDERSTAND CAREFULLY, how this is done.

2. We also understand, how to access the number of rows and columns in 2D arrays. PLEASE UNDERSTAND CAREFULLY.


package forTesting;

public class SingleAndMultiDimentionalArraysInitialization {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Initializing single dimensional arrays. Doing initialization in this way, does not require use of 'new' operator.
	String[] OneDArray = {"hello","world","my","name","is"};  
	int[] intArray = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
	
// Initialzing 2d array. Doing initialization in this way, does not require use of 'new' operator.
	String[][] TwoDArray = {{"hello","world"},{"hi","bye"},{"me","tu"},{"aapli","aapla"}}; // 4*2 array
	int[][] intTwoArray = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{8,9,10},{11,12,13},{14,15,16}}; // 3*5 array
	
// Accessing number of rows and columns in multidimentional arrays
	int rows = TwoDArray.length;       // Gives number of rows
	int columns = TwoDArray[0].length;   // Gives number of coulmns
	
	System.out.println(rows);
	System.out.println(columns);
}
}
